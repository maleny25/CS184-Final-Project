    <h1 align="middle">Summary</h1>
    <p>
      For our CS 184 final project, we are planning to create a kiwi vine growth simulation. We plan to make it look
      realistic and use L-Systems to simulate the growth.
    </p>

    <h1 align="middle">Problem Description</h1>

    <p>
      We are planning to tackle this problem of simulating accurate growth of a kiwi vine. After researching multiple
      ideas, we landed on this based on the research that has already been done. We want to learn and apply the
      mathematical models that are used to simulate the growth of the kiwi vine. This project will simulate the physics
      from nature of the growth process. It will be a challenge for us because we have to learn about L-Systems to be
      able to simulate the growth. We are planning to tackle this problem by breaking it into parts of encoding accurate
      plant structure (including branching and leaf growth), rendering the plant successfully, and incorporating
      environmental factors.
    </p>

    <h1 align="middle">Goals and Deliverables</h1>
    <p>The main goal of our project is to create an accurate simulation of kiwi plant growth in average conditions. This
      can be broken down into several parts: encoding accurate plant structure (including branching and leaf growth),
      rendering the plant successfully, and incorporating environmental factors.
    </p>
    <p>Much of our work will be based on the equations and model published in the paper, “A functional-structural
      kiwifruit vine model integrating architecture, carbon dynamics and effects of the environment”. Several images
      from this model are shown below. We hope to successfully recreate renderings like this, and if that is successful,
      we will implement a growing model that may be adjusted in real time with carbon inputs. If things go smoothly with
      these two main goals, we will then adapt our code to simulate other plants given certain governing growth
      equations. This would be possible through further research of plant architecture and growing patterns, but we may
      not have time to accomplish.
    </p>
    <p>Our simulation's success will be mostly determined through qualitative judgements, although we can compare it to
      the paper's model under standard lighting conditions to ensure the two plants' growth occurs at the same rate.
    </p>

    <p>If we finish our goal ahead of schedule, we have several possible extensions. We hope to implement at least one
      of the ideas. One is adding lighting conditions such as outdoor lighting vs indoor lighting, another one would be
      to simulate the outdoor light of different times of the day. A second would be adding on vegetative growth and
      fruit growth on our models. This means that fruits will appear at the right time steps and grow with the rest of
      the plant at a reasonable rate. </p>

    <h1 align="middle">Schedule</h1>
    <p>Week 1: Create Github repository, get familiar with WebGL and L-systems (get basic tree growth to work), create T
      structure which will be the starting point of our vine
      <br>
      Week 2: Shoot Development and Vine Architecture - create nodes and generate new nodes using the markov chains
      stated in the paper referenced
      <br>
      Week 3: Carbon Dynamics and Root growth - Use the Euler method as stated in the paper referenced to simulate
      carbon flow which will determine the flux of root growth

      <br>
      Week 4: Vegetative Growth and Fruit Growth (if time permits)
    </p>
